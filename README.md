# eBonjour Tool

![Screenshot](/images/example.png)

This project was started because I was getting fed up of the bonjour discovery client for MacOS being so awful to use so I created my own using electron and vue as a learning experience, the UI components are from ant-design and bonjour discovery is made possible using watsons bonjour library (https://github.com/watson/bonjour)
