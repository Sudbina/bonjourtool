# sudbina-electronic-vue

> An electron-vue project

This project was started because I was getting fed up of the bonjour discovery client for MacOS being so awful to use and look at so I created my own using electron and vue, the UI elements are from ant-design (https://www.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/) and bonjour discovery is made possible using watsons bonjour library (https://github.com/watson/bonjour)

The primary use case for this is finding IoT devices for work purposes but I will eventually adapt this to be a feature rich client.
